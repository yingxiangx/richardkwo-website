== Short Bio

I am now a second-year PhD in the Department Computer Science, Duke University. I am working on machine learning with [http://stat.duke.edu/~kheller/ /Professor Katherine Heller/].

Before that, I got my bachelors degree in computer science from [http://www.oice.uestc.edu.cn/en/ University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)] in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu Chengdu], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan Sichuan]. (/Chengdu is my 2nd hometown where I lived for 7 years./) I was a member of its [http://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/ Yingcai Experimental School], where I attended a comprehensive spectrum of courses in science and engineering (/math & physics are fun, while circuits are not.../). As part of my undergraduate studies, I worked with [http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXgWgmEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao Prof. Tao Zhou] on a few research topics related to human behaviors and social networks, including ranking algorithms, modeling social network evolution and statistical properties of human behaviors.

Even before that, I grew up in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deyang Deyang], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan Sichuan], in the community of a [http://www.china-erzhong.com/erzhong-en/ huge state-owned factory] (/heavy industrial parts still evoke my childhood belongingness/), where most of my family members are\/were working. Then I attended the century-old [http://www.cdqz.net/ Chengdu No. 7 High School].

While being a CS major, physics has also been my long-time fascination. I am interested in research that explores the deep connections between machine learning and statistical physics.
